		Hello! My name's Sam Brewster and I'm a front-end web developer.</p> <p>Right now you'll find me teaching English and studying web development in Shenzhen, China. If I'm not in the classroom or at my computer, I'm probably playing soccer, boxing, or making craft beer in my apartment's tiny Chinese kitchen.

		I have just over one year's experience working with small, local clients to provide responsive, thoughtfully-designed, and functional websites.</p> <p>I'm constantly improving my skillset by studying and implementing different technologies in my work, and I look forward to learning more and more. <p>Here's what I'm familar with so far:</p>
